## Description <a name="description"></a>
This is my portfolio and it includes ```About Me```, ```Projects```, ```Contact Me```, and ```Resume``` sections.  The portfolio also includes links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow profiles.  The application was built using ```create-react-app``` and currently does not include a back-end.  The application utilizes FontAwesome for the GitHub icon and was styled completely in vanilla CSS.  Media queries are used for mobile responsiveness.
